“O’ Allah, I’m seeking your counsel through Your [Infinite] Knowledge, and I’m asking You for strength through Your Divine Ability, and I’m asking You from Your Infinite Grace. Because You’re completely able to do, while I simply cannot. You know everything, and I do not, and You are the Knower of the unseen. O’ Allah, if You know that this affair [mention decision or dua here] is good for me in my religion, my life, and afterlife, then decree it for me, facilitate it with ease, and bless me through it. But, if You know that this affair is bad for me in my religion, my life, and afterlife, then keep it away from me and keep me away from it and decree what’s better for me, whatever it may be, and make me content with it.” <a href="https://sunnah.com/bukhari:6382"> [Sahih Al-Bukhari]</a></p>

	<p>The benefits of Istikhara prayer are immense, from transparency in complex matters to being able to get Allah’s support and getting closer to Him. When a person on earth calls upon Allah after waking in the middle of the night, He highly admires his act, listens to his supplication, and mentions his name in front of the angels.

<br><b>Shah Waliyyullah (RA) says</b>: <blockquote>“From amongst the greatest benefits of Istikhara is that man becomes detached from his carnal desires, his animalistic characteristics become subject to his angelic nature, and he hands himself over to Allah. When he does this, he reaches the stages of the angels whose quality is that they await the command of Allah. When Allah’s command is received, they exert themselves through divine motivation and not carnal motivation. I believe that excessive Istikhara is a proven tonic for the inculcation of angelic qualities.”</blockquote></br>

When Unable to Pray Istikhara: If you are wondering that can you do Istikhara on your period or while traveling, you should know that you can definitely say the dua of Istikhara and ask for the guidance of Allah the Almighty.</p>
